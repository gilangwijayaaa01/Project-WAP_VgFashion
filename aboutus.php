      Initially, VG Fashion was a conventional clothing store without a website or data-based system. However, when the pandemic hit, our sales were significantly affected. 
      Manual recording using a file system has become increasingly difficult in this digital era. Therefore, VG Fashion decided to completely modernize our system, switching 
      from a manual system to a web application that makes it easier for customers to shop online. Even so, VG Fashion still maintains the sales method in physical stores, so customers 
      can choose between shopping directly or online according to their preferences.
